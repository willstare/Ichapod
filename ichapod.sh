# Ichapod by Patrick Simonds (divinitycycle@gmail.com)
# This script is inspired by BashPodder, but I wanted much fancier output options
# 
#
#This script has been updated in 2018. Notible changes include using wget to download the RSS to a 'current.rss' file before xsltproc processes the RSS. There seemed to be an issue with using xsltproc to grab the file.
#

## SETTINGS ##
##############
# In the default setup, Ichapod is installed to /usr/share/ichapod
# It should be possible to put any of the files associated with it pretty much anywhere.
# This is where you want to finished podcast files to go
destinationfolder="" #Example destinationfolder="/mnt/plex/Podcasts"

# This is where you are storing the ichapod.sh script.
scriptfolder="" # Example scriptfolder="/home/plex/scripts/ichapod"
# This is the file containing your podcasts to be downloaded
podcastlist="" # Example podcastlist="/home/plexadmin/scripts/ichapod/podcasts.txt"

# This is the number of days old an item can be and still be downloaded.
# If you set the agelimit to 12 and Ichapod gets a story that's 2 weeks old, it will skip it.
agelimit="5";

# Download Log
# This file is maintained & used by Ichapod and isn't intended to be human readable.
# It prevents Ichapod from trying to download a file it has already downloaded.
downloadlog="" # Example downloadlog="/home/plexadmin/scripts/ichapod/downloadedpodcasts.log"

# Daily Log File
# If you are running Ichapod via cron and logging the output to a file, you can tell Ichapod where the file is
# to allow it to insert a custom log header into it.
dailylog="-`date +\%Y-\%m-\%d`.log"; # Example dailylog="/home/plexadmin/scripts/ichapod/ichapod-`date +\%Y-\%m-\%d`.log";

# Daily Log Header
# this is the text you want inserted at the top of your daily log file.
dailylogheader=$( echo -e "#################################################\n############# ICHAPOD ## `date +\%m-\%d-\%Y` #############\n#################################################\n \n" );

# This should be pointed at the xsl file in your Ichapod location.
# You usually do not need to mess with this, just give the location of the included file
processorfile="" # Example processorfile="/home/plexadmin/scripts/ichapod/readpodcast.xsl"

# This is a temporary log, used to collect output for debugging purposes.
# Its rebuilt every time Ichapod is run, useful if you're trying to see what happened during the last run.
# You can usually just leave the default.
debuglog=""; # Example debuglog="/home/plexadmin/scripts/ichapod/ichapod-lastrun.log";

# END SETTINGS ###################################

# Begin actual script #############################
# First we check that the daily log variables have been set, but the current log file is empty.
# If so, its the first run of the day, and we should output the header.
